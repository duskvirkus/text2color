  /* Tips:
   * 
   * - Don't use random() but use randomFromNoise() instead which works 
   *   pretty much the same as random() from p5.js just you can't give it an 
   *   array of values.
   * 
   * - Use text.charCodeAt(index) to get the ASCII code for a character.
   * 
   * - Remember to return a return color(0) or color(255) at the end to catch 
   *   any cases you might not have accounted for.
   * 
   * - Use helper functions if needed just name them something like 
   *   functionNameHelper() or something that's unlikely to overlap with other 
   *   function names. Include them in the same file as your main function.
   * 
   * - Include colorMode() at the beginning to insure you're function always is 
   *   using the correct mode. Feel free to use modes other than RGB.
